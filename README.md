**Table 2**: Classification accuracy and standard error of our method across 3 independent runs on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using VGG-11 as the teacher and ResNet-18 as the student. Results demonstrate consistency and robustness of the proposed approach.

| Dataset   | Method | Accuracy (%) | Standard Error |
|-----------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| CIFAR-10  | Ours   | 92.50         | ±0.12          |
| CIFAR-100 | Ours   | 72.06         | ±0.08          |
